## Description

It seems like in this horrifying new world of digital supremacy you can’t do much without knowing how to code. Whether you want to write a Telegram bot, build a website, automate Blender, write a webcrawler, get the most from Touch Designer, program a microcontroller or run the hottest new machine learning models, Python always always seems to slither onto the scene. 

This course will take some time to review the basics of programming in Python before looking at a few interesting examples of how you can use python to elevate, automate or activate your creative processes. Curiosity is the key to confidence, so this class will encourage curiosity. There will be lots of time for questions and lots of opportunity to direct the examples we do together as a class.

In the first half of the course we will review some programming basics and move on to  some intermediate topics that will help you get the most from Python. The second half of the course will cover specific applications in response to the creative interests of the class. The intention is to show examples that will be most useful to you as you develop your own specific projects.

## In this course, you will be introduced to…

-   A review of how Python fits into the programming world and its strengths and weaknesses
-   A review of the basics for running and writing good code
-   Introduction to Git
-   An introduction to Jupyter Notebooks and Google Collab
-   Using and installing modules, managing imports and virtual environments
-   Moving and managing files and images
-   Using JSON and making API requests
-   Advances applications chosen by the class (e.g Telegram bots, LLMs, Python with Blender, Python with Touch Designer, OSC for communicating with other programs)
