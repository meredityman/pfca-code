## Notes on Python

According to ChatGPT:


> "Python is a high-level, dynamically typed, interpreted language that is known for its simplicity, readability, and flexibility. Some of the key features that distinguish Python from other programming languages include:
> 
> * __Simplicity and Readability:__ Python emphasizes on code readability and simplicity, which means that it is easy to understand and maintain even for beginners. It has a clean and concise syntax with a high degree of expressiveness, making it easy to learn and use.
> * __Interpreted:__ Python is an interpreted language, meaning that there is no need for a separate compilation step before executing the code. The interpreter executes the code line by line, which enables developers to test their code quickly and easily.
> * __Cross-platform:__ Python is a cross-platform language, which means that it can run on different operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Unix.
> * __Large Standard Library:__ Python comes with a vast standard library that provides a wide range of modules for tasks like file I/O, network programming, web development, and more. This library makes it easier for developers to accomplish complex tasks without having to write the code from scratch.
> * __Dynamically Typed:__ Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that the type of a variable is determined at runtime rather than at compile time. This allows developers to write code more quickly and flexibly, without having to declare types explicitly.
> * __Object-Oriented:__ Python is an object-oriented language that supports classes, objects, and inheritance. This makes it easier to write complex programs by breaking them down into smaller, reusable modules.
> * __Extensible:__ Python is an extensible language, which means that it can be easily extended using modules and packages written in other languages like C, C++, and Java.
> 
> Overall, Python's simplicity, readability, and flexibility have made it a popular language for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more."
